      KnightKrawler has an "official" season that starts at <a href="/glossary#infonight">Information Night</a>
      and ends after our last competition.  The last competition could be a regional in March or April if the
      team fails to qualify for Championships (late April) or the State Tournament (mid-May).

        However robotics is a year-round activity for some students.  The mentors attempt to take a one month break for most of June.
        Optional meetings are typically held 1-2 days per week in the summer where students can work on special projects,
        such as building a new drive mechanism the team has not tried before, or programming an <a href="/glossary#autonomous">autonomous</a> routine.
        The team also does various outreach activities during the summer.
